# Neural-Radiance-Field

Neural Radiance Field or NeRF is a technique to represent a scene in the form of a network of encoded information. In theory, it takes a series of images taken from different positions and perspectives of an object, and from a learned function, is able to produce novel views of the object. This technique was first introduced in the paper [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) by Ben Mildenhall et al. in 2020.

This repository is an implementation of the ideas and techniques presented in the paper.
